const config: YtDlpConfig = { workdir: "./downloads" }
const ytDlp = new YtDlp(config)
```

await ytDlp.downloadLatestReleaseIfNotExists()
```

### Download Video

	url: "https://youtube.com/watch?v=example",
	format: "ba", // best audio
})
```

const mediaInfo = await ytDlp.retrieveMediaInfoList(
	"https://youtube.com/watch?v=example"
)
```

```typescript
const subtitleText = await ytDlp.downloadSubtitleText({
	info: mediaInfo[0],
	lang: "en",
})
```

## Practical Examples

### Batch Download

Download multiple videos by passing a list of URLs:

```typescript
for (const url of [
	"https://youtube.com/watch?v=example1",
	"https://youtube.com/watch?v=example2",
]) {
	await ytDlp.download({ url })
}
```

### Advanced Subtitle Handling

Download subtitles in different languages and formats, then extract and save the text:

```typescript
const langs: Language[] = ["en", "es", "de"]
for (const lang of langs) {
	const subtitlePath = await ytDlp.downloadSubtitle({ info: mediaInfo[0], lang })
	const extractedText = ytDlp.extractTextFromSubtitles(subtitlePath)
	console.log(`Extracted Text in ${lang}:`, extractedText)
}
```

### Error Handling

Implement robust error handling to manage potential download and extraction failures:

```typescript
try {
	const videoUrls = await ytDlp.download({
		url: "https://youtube.com/watch?v=example",
	})
} catch (error) {
	console.error("Failed to download video:", error)
}
```
